And when we are buried in the tiny details of the work of our team, it detracts from\u00a0that.</p>\n<p>Big picture thinking and intuition go hand in hand, and when both are functioning well, you are able to be an effective manager. When micromanaging, your effectiveness degrades, and so does your\u00a0team\u2019s.</p>\n<blockquote>When you do your team\u2019s work for them, rather than guiding them and allowing them to grow, no one wins. The overall capability of your team remains weak\u2026 (<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/11/stop-doing-your-teams-work-for-them\">Harvard Business\u00a0Review</a>)</blockquote>\n<h3>Micromanaging vs Attention to\u00a0Detail</h3>\n<p>Micromanaging and having attention to detail are related concepts, but they differ significantly in terms of their approach, purpose, and impact on a team or\u00a0project.</p>\n<p><strong>Micromanaging</strong> is an overbearing and excessively controlling management style where a manager closely supervises and controls every aspect of their team\u2019s work. It involves a high level of involvement in even the smallest details of\u00a0tasks.</p>\n<p><strong>Attention to detail</strong> is a positive quality that involves a careful and thorough examination of tasks, processes, and projects. It focuses on ensuring that work is accurate and free from errors or oversights. A manager with a strong attention to detail can still trust their team, but takes a vigilant approach to quality\u00a0control.</p>\n<h3>Big Picture Thinking as a\u00a0Manager</h3>\n<p>Seeing the big picture as a manager means having the ability to view the organization, its goals, and its challenges from a broader and more strategic perspective. It involves understanding how various components of the business interconnect, how cross-functional teams work best together, identifying long-term objectives, and recognizing the impact of decisions on the overall success of the organization.</p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t just seeing a quarter or three down the road, but knowing how the other aspects and goals of the business dovetail with yours in a cohesive manner. Like driving on the highway, you look out in front of you, as well as to the sides and behind you. (An individual contributor is only <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tristandenyer/an-individual-contributor-is-only-looking-out-for-friday-f4addf499fa2\">looking out in front of them</a>, generally and relatively speaking.)</p>\n<p><strong>When you lose big picture thinking</strong>, you lose the ability to see how your component fits in with the other components of the organization. This can cause misalignment for your work within the organization.</p>\n<h3>Your Intuition as a\u00a0Manager</h3>\n<p>Having great intuition as a manager means possessing a keen and insightful understanding of situations, people, and issues that go beyond the information presented on the surface. It involves the ability to make quick, effective decisions and judgments, often based on a combination of experience, pattern recognition, and emotional intelligence.</p>\n<p>Or, to put it another way: This is about being able to see around corners, and through projects to the sticking points before they happen. Your intuition comes not only from years of experience, but also from having the headspace to see\u00a0it.</p>\n<p><strong>When you lose intuition</strong>, you lost your connection to your past experience and your ability to apply it to the work being done. You may end up having increased rework, missing deadlines, and or not aligning with the broader organization.</p>\n<h3>How Micromanaging Is Detrimental to Your Effectiveness as a\u00a0Manager</h3>\n<p>Effective leadership involves trust, delegation, and empowerment. This enables your team members to take ownership of their work and contribute to the organization\u2019s success. Each one of those effective traits gives a manager more time and space to see the bigger picture through connecting with other managers on cross-functional teams.</p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t already doing this, you should be scheduling one-on-ones with the managers you will be interacting with most in the upcoming 2\u20133 quarters.

Here are some tips to help you recognize signs of micromanagement in your leadership style, and course\u00a0correct:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are you <strong>constantly monitoring</strong> every task and demanding frequent updates from your team? Trusting your team involves giving them the space to work without constant surveillance. Do you need to sign every report, or can you train a senior direct report of yours to take on 90% of\u00a0them?</li>\n<li>Do you notice a <strong>lack of enthusiasm</strong> or disengagement among multiple team members? Micromanaged employees may feel demotivated, undervalued, and disempowered. Ask for feedback on your managing style, and ways to improve. Emphasis on the latter so as to show that you are looking to grow in ways that help you show up for your\u00a0team.</li>\n<li>Micromanagers may <strong>tightly control communication</strong> channels, insisting that all communication goes through them. This can stifle open and direct communication among team members, and learning. Be in the kick-off call, but openly express that you are looking to be included in less meetings moving forward, and be kept informed of decisions. Not <em>asked</em>, but <em>informed</em>\u2014a big difference.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are but a few of the signs of micromanaging. Recognizing these signs and being open to feedback is the first step toward developing a more empowering and trusting leadership approach. Micromanagement can have detrimental effects on team morale, creativity, and productivity, so it\u2019s crucial to find a balance that allows for autonomy and\u00a0growth.</p>\n<h3>Get a\u00a0Coach</h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to grow as a leader and manager is to <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tristandenyer/investing-in-coaches-for-your-leaders-is-a-major-competitive-advantage-3ceff0fcda58\">hire a coach</a>.

While it\u2019s natural to seek comfort and security, embracing calculated risks\u2014within reasonable bounds and with a healthy approach\u2014can offer several mental health benefits and a more fulfilling life.</p>\n<p><strong>Being an effective leader requires a number of personal strengths that can be enhanced by taking periodic risks.</strong> To help keep you growing, these can be done daily or\u00a0weekly.</p>\n<p>A friend of mine calls them \u201cdares\u201d because it\u2019s more motivational to her. I like that, so choose what works best for you. This should be motivational and not some dry, daily\u00a0task.</p>\n<h3>Take the Risk; Don\u2019t Be\u00a0Risky</h3>\n<p>First, \u201cbeing risky\u201d and \u201ctaking risks\u201d may seem similar, but they have subtle differences in meaning and\u00a0usage:</p>\n<h4>Taking Risks</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Active decision: </strong>\u201cTaking risks\u201d involves making a conscious choice to engage in actions or decisions that have an element of uncertainty or potential negative outcomes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Purposeful action:</strong> Taking risks suggests a purposeful action or decision in pursuit of a goal or a desire for a specific outcome. It often implies a calculated evaluation of the potential benefits and drawbacks.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Measured approach:</strong> When you take risks, you typically consider the pros and cons, gather information, and assess the likelihood of success or\u00a0failure.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Conscious involvement:</strong> Taking risks requires conscious involvement and a degree of control over the situation. You are an active participant in the\u00a0process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Being Risky</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Inherent trait or behavior: </strong>\u201cBeing risky\u201d describes a trait or inherent behavior of an individual, suggesting that the person is naturally inclined toward taking risks or engaging in activities that are perceived as\u00a0risky.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Characteristic or nature: </strong>It\u2019s more about the person\u2019s characteristic or nature rather than a specific action or decision. Someone who is \u201crisky\u201d may have a propensity to engage in adventurous or daring activities regularly.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Less calculated: </strong>Being risky may not necessarily involve a calculated evaluation of the potential consequences. It implies a willingness to embrace uncertainty without extensive analysis.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Spontaneous or unplanned:</strong> Being risky often suggests a more spontaneous or unplanned approach. It may involve taking risks without a clear strategy or forethought.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Embracing the act of taking a risk doesn\u2019t mean recklessness; it means thoughtful, calculated steps outside your comfort zone. It\u2019s about assessing risks, setting reasonable goals, and considering potential rewards and consequences. Taking risks may feel uncomfortable at times, but it\u2019s within those discomfort zones that growth, fulfillment, and personal enrichment are often\u00a0found.</p>\n<h3>The Benefits of Taking\u00a0Risks</h3>\n<p>The benefits managers and leadership can get from taking periodic risks include (but are by no means limited\u00a0to):</p>\n<h4>Becoming a More Interesting Person</h4>\n<p>One of the most significant benefits of taking risks is personal growth. And one of the knock-on effects of this is that you become a more interesting person. When you step out of your comfort zone, you expose yourself to new experiences and challenges. These challenges can lead to personal development as you learn new skills, adapt to changing circumstances, and gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your capabilities. And that gets shared with the people around you, making you more interesting.</p>\n<h4>Increased Self-Confidence</h4>\n<p>Taking a risk, no matter how small, boosts your self-confidence. Each successful risk you take reinforces your belief in your ability to handle difficulties and uncertainties, making you more self-assured in leading a project and or\u00a0team.</p>\n<h4>Overcoming Fear and\u00a0Anxiety</h4>\n<p>Taking risks often means facing fears and uncertainties head-on. The more you confront your fears, the more you desensitize yourself to those stressors. This can lead to reduced anxiety and a greater sense of emotional well-being.</p>\n<h4>Resilience and Adaptability</h4>\n<p>Risk-taking encourages creative problem-solving and adaptability. When you need to navigate unexpected challenges, you develop resilience and become better equipped to handle adversity, which is vital for leading\u00a0teams.</p>\n<h4>Sense of Accomplishment</h4>\n<p>Achieving a challenging goal or overcoming a fear through risk-taking can provide a deep sense of accomplishment. This accomplishment can lead to feelings of happiness and pride, enhancing your overall\u00a0mood.</p>\n<h4>Expanding Your Comfort\u00a0Zone</h4>\n<p>As you consistently take risks\u2014again, on a daily or weekly cadence\u2014your comfort zone expands. Activities that once felt daunting become more manageable, making it easier to tackle even greater challenges in the\u00a0future.</p>\n<h4>Improved Decision-Making</h4>\n<p>Risk-taking involves evaluating options, making decisions, and learning from the consequences. Over time, you become a more agile decision-maker, which can lead to more thoughtful and effective choices in managing projects and\u00a0teams.</p>\n<h4>Building Resilience to\u00a0Failure</h4>\n<p>Risk-taking inherently involves the possibility of failure. Learning to cope with and bounce back from failures builds emotional resilience and reduces the fear of setbacks, making you more adaptable and less risk-averse.</p>\n<h3>How to Take Risks for Personal\u00a0Growth</h3>\n<p>We aren\u2019t talking about jumping out of a plane or scaling a cliff face without a rope. Small risks such as asking a friend for a referral, striking up a conversation with a stranger, or taking an unknown route to work can yield enough benefits to help you\u00a0grow.</p>\n<p>Like putting $50 or $100 in a savings account each month, it builds and grows on compound interest. Same goes for risks. Start small, and as your resilience and adaptability get stronger, your next risk is handled with that much more resiliency and confidence. Also, nothing wrong in keeping with the small risks\u2014it\u2019s all about taking steps toward\u00a0growth.</p>\n<p>Each morning, think up a risk to take for the day, and write it down. This can be along the lines\u00a0of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cCall client and ask for more\u00a0work.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cText friend and ask for that shirt back that they borrowed.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cTell my kid to ask me three questions about anything.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cI secretly order dinner for my partner, while secretly they order for\u00a0me.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the above can go sideways, to some degree. That\u2019s the\u00a0risk.</p>\n<h3>Challenge Yourself</h3>\n<p>I like to take a daily risk in my personal life, and these are sometimes spur of the moment type things. I also like to take a weekly risk in my professional life, and these tend to be more calculated, or measured\u2014but still a\u00a0risk.</p>\n<p>I have found that it works best if you set a reminder to do this at least once a week. You can also journal about it afterward to help reinforce your learnings and see your confidence grow.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3ce656ea8328\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4>Dive into your unknown strengths through taking periodic risks in your\u00a0life.</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*juPr0IAZv3FT_bfl\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@sandbarproductions?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Chase Baker</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>At the heart of personal growth lies the willingness to take risks.

Taking risks may feel uncomfortable at times, but it\u2019s within those discomfort zones that growth, fulfillment, and personal enrichment are often\u00a0found.</p>\n<h3>The Benefits of Taking\u00a0Risks</h3>\n<p>The benefits managers and leadership can get from taking periodic risks include (but are by no means limited\u00a0to):</p>\n<h4>Becoming a More Interesting Person</h4>\n<p>One of the most significant benefits of taking risks is personal growth. And one of the knock-on effects of this is that you become a more interesting person. When you step out of your comfort zone, you expose yourself to new experiences and challenges. These challenges can lead to personal development as you learn new skills, adapt to changing circumstances, and gain a deeper understanding of yourself and your capabilities. And that gets shared with the people around you, making you more interesting.</p>\n<h4>Increased Self-Confidence</h4>\n<p>Taking a risk, no matter how small, boosts your self-confidence. Each successful risk you take reinforces your belief in your ability to handle difficulties and uncertainties, making you more self-assured in leading a project and or\u00a0team.</p>\n<h4>Overcoming Fear and\u00a0Anxiety</h4>\n<p>Taking risks often means facing fears and uncertainties head-on. The more you confront your fears, the more you desensitize yourself to those stressors. This can lead to reduced anxiety and a greater sense of emotional well-being.</p>\n<h4>Resilience and Adaptability</h4>\n<p>Risk-taking encourages creative problem-solving and adaptability. When you need to navigate unexpected challenges, you develop resilience and become better equipped to handle adversity, which is vital for leading\u00a0teams.</p>\n<h4>Sense of Accomplishment</h4>\n<p>Achieving a challenging goal or overcoming a fear through risk-taking can provide a deep sense of accomplishment. This accomplishment can lead to feelings of happiness and pride, enhancing your overall\u00a0mood.</p>\n<h4>Expanding Your Comfort\u00a0Zone</h4>\n<p>As you consistently take risks\u2014again, on a daily or weekly cadence\u2014your comfort zone expands. Activities that once felt daunting become more manageable, making it easier to tackle even greater challenges in the\u00a0future.</p>\n<h4>Improved Decision-Making</h4>\n<p>Risk-taking involves evaluating options, making decisions, and learning from the consequences. Over time, you become a more agile decision-maker, which can lead to more thoughtful and effective choices in managing projects and\u00a0teams.</p>\n<h4>Building Resilience to\u00a0Failure</h4>\n<p>Risk-taking inherently involves the possibility of failure. Learning to cope with and bounce back from failures builds emotional resilience and reduces the fear of setbacks, making you more adaptable and less risk-averse.</p>\n<h3>How to Take Risks for Personal\u00a0Growth</h3>\n<p>We aren\u2019t talking about jumping out of a plane or scaling a cliff face without a rope. Small risks such as asking a friend for a referral, striking up a conversation with a stranger, or taking an unknown route to work can yield enough benefits to help you\u00a0grow.</p>\n<p>Like putting $50 or $100 in a savings account each month, it builds and grows on compound interest. Same goes for risks. Start small, and as your resilience and adaptability get stronger, your next risk is handled with that much more resiliency and confidence. Also, nothing wrong in keeping with the small risks\u2014it\u2019s all about taking steps toward\u00a0growth.</p>\n<p>Each morning, think up a risk to take for the day, and write it down. This can be along the lines\u00a0of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\u201cCall client and ask for more\u00a0work.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cText friend and ask for that shirt back that they borrowed.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cTell my kid to ask me three questions about anything.\u201d</li>\n<li>\u201cI secretly order dinner for my partner, while secretly they order for\u00a0me.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of the above can go sideways, to some degree. That\u2019s the\u00a0risk.</p>\n<h3>Challenge Yourself</h3>\n<p>I like to take a daily risk in my personal life, and these are sometimes spur of the moment type things. I also like to take a weekly risk in my professional life, and these tend to be more calculated, or measured\u2014but still a\u00a0risk.</p>\n<p>I have found that it works best if you set a reminder to do this at least once a week. You can also journal about it afterward to help reinforce your learnings and see your confidence grow.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3ce656ea8328\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["risk-taking","management","risk-management","team-building","leadership"]},{"title":"Tips for How to Give a Referral That Helps Both of You","pubDate":"2023-11-06 14:06:01","link":"https://tristandenyer.medium.com/tips-for-how-to-give-a-referral-that-helps-both-of-you-788f8376b5ac?source=rss-319fdd00a93f------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/788f8376b5ac","author":"Tristan Denyer","thumbnail":"","description":"\n<h4>You can still make a great referral, even if you have little to no status or influence.

When you give a thoughtful referral, that person will remember it, and in this world of hyper-connectivity, there is a good chance your name will cross their path again in some\u00a0way.</p>\n<p>Another important one is the receiver of the referral. I\u2019ve had times where my referral put me in a good light. I happened to put in a good word for a designer that the hiring team loved, and ended up hiring. She went on to help them in a huge way, and the hiring manager never forgot my name. She even reached out to me a number of times thanking me for the referral and asked if I knew of anyone else that could they could hire! That\u2019s how you want to be remembered!</p>\n<p>Lastly, the person you refer does not have to get hired for the referral to \u2018hit\u2019 and be successful for both of you. The success is outlined\u00a0below.</p>\n<h3>Here Are Some Tips on How to Give a Referral Effectively</h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to hit all of these. Read through them to see where you can level up your referrals.</p>\n<h4>First, Consider the Delivery\u00a0Method</h4>\n<p>Today, we have a number of ways to send a referral to someone. Email, text, phone, in-person, and even via social media channels. Consider the person you are contacting, and why you are connecting them. Depending on what this is for and where they work, certain ways and channels can come across as tone deaf, or get buried and lost, or be too\u00a0forward.</p>\n<h4>Know the Person\u00a0Well</h4>\n<p>Before giving a referral, make sure you know the individual well enough to vouch for their skills, character, or qualifications. A strong referral is based on a genuine understanding of the person\u2019s abilities and attributes. Don\u2019t speak to anything you don\u2019t understand or know\u2014you may be asked to clarify later, and you don\u2019t want to\u00a0stumble.</p>\n<h4>Ask for Permission</h4>\n<p>Typically you are being asked for a referral, but I\u2019ve had there be times where I wanted to refer someone I felt should connect in some way. Always ask the person you\u2019re referring if they are comfortable with you providing a referral. This ensures they\u2019re open to the idea and gives them the opportunity to decline if they\u2019re not interested.</p>\n<h4>Gather Relevant Information</h4>\n<p>Collect all the necessary information about the person you\u2019re referring, including their resume, work samples, or any other documents that will help you provide a comprehensive and accurate referral. If someone is asking you to refer them, ask them to provide these\u00a0details.</p>\n<h4>Specify the\u00a0Purpose</h4>\n<p>Clearly understand the purpose of the referral. Is it for a job application, a business partnership, or a personal introduction? Tailor your referral to the specific context. Read the job description, and like you would for a cover letter (do they still do those?) or email, pepper in key words from the\u00a0posting.</p>\n<h4>Highlight Strengths and Achievements</h4>\n<p>When giving a referral, emphasize the individual\u2019s strengths, achievements, and qualities that make them stand out. Be specific and provide examples of their accomplishments. Again, you should be able to get these from them directly, and if you know them very well, conjure them up from\u00a0memory.</p>\n<h4>Be Forthright</h4>\n<p>Honesty is essential when giving a referral. Don\u2019t exaggerate or provide false information. It\u2019s better to acknowledge areas where the person may have room for improvement.</p>\n<h4>Context Matters</h4>\n<p>Provide context for the referral by explaining how you know the person and under what circumstances you\u2019ve observed their skills or qualities. This helps establish your credibility as a referrer. If you don\u2019t know them at all, be forthright here, but downplay it a bit. \u201c<em>_____ reached out to me, and after careful review, I feel they would be someone to consider\u2026</em>\u201d</p>\n<h4>Use Professional Language</h4>\n<p>Maintain a professional tone and language in your referral. Be warm, but avoid overly casual or overly formal language, depending on the\u00a0context.</p>\n<h4>Include Contact Information</h4>\n<p>If the recipient of the referral may want to get in touch with the individual you\u2019re referring, include their contact information, such as email or phone number. Ask before you share this out for which contact information they would prefer you\u00a0share.</p>\n<h4>Offer to Connect Personally</h4>\n<p>If you\u2019re comfortable with it, let the person you\u2019re referring know that you\u2019re willing to connect them directly with the person or entity they\u2019re seeking the referral for. I feel this is some good reinforcement behind your referring them as your additional time on the matter lends some weight to\u00a0it.</p>\n<h4>Be Responsive to Inquiries</h4>\n<p>If someone reaches out to you for more information about the person you referred, respond promptly and provide helpful insights. Again, the added time you are investing in this adds weight behind the referral.</p>\n<h4>Respect Privacy</h4>\n<p>Respect the privacy and confidentiality of the person you\u2019re referring. Don\u2019t disclose any sensitive or personal information without their\u00a0consent.</p>\n<h4>Thank You\u00a0Note</h4>\n<p>If the referral leads to a positive outcome, consider sending a thank-you note to express your gratitude for the opportunity to provide a referral. Again, this is more for you than anything. A good referral will go a long way for\u00a0you.</p>\n<h4>Stay in\u00a0Touch</h4>\n<p>Stay connected with both the person you referred and the recipient. It\u2019s an excellent way to maintain and strengthen your\u00a0network.</p>\n<h4>Sometimes It\u2019s Better to Not Send the\u00a0Referral</h4>\n<p>Be careful with your referrals, and don\u2019t just send them out freely. Your name is attached to these, and if someone or somewhere gets a barrage of these from you, it can backfire. Unless you are set up as a pipeline for referrals, keep it to a minimum and spread it\u00a0around.</p>\n<h3>In Summary</h3>\n<p>Remember that giving a referral is a significant responsibility, and it\u2019s a reflection of your judgment and credibility. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to provide honest and well-considered referrals that genuinely benefit all parties involved.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=788f8376b5ac\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4>You can still make a great referral, even if you have little to no status or influence.

And that one time I got interviewed by a\u00a0dog.</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*j8f17xaIr0G-0odU\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Christina @ wocintechchat.com</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Over the years, I have participated in more than 500 interviews. As a candidate, as a peer, as a hiring manager, as a moderator on panels and even that one time where I interviewed twice in one day because they mixed us up. I once interviewed over 20 candidates in one\u00a0week.</p>\n<p>Did I mention I once got interview by a CEO\u2019s dog? Yeah, that happened.</p>\n<p>Here is what I have learned and use as a hiring\u00a0manager.</p>\n<h3>Snowflakes</h3>\n<p>No two interviews were ever the same. You would think with that many there would be some <em>deju vu</em> or repeats. But, no, I felt every one of them was run differently, had different patterns and workflows, or some oddity to it. (Again, who has their dog interview the candidate? Am I missing something here?)</p>\n<p>And not every interview should be run the same. As we will get to below, you should match the interview process to the day-to-day activities for that\u00a0role.</p>\n<h3>It Really Matters Who You\u00a0Know</h3>\n<p>This can be a referral from within, a shared coworker from the past, or a mentor or coach reaching out for them. I always find these to be a mixed bag, and learned to ask clarifying questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How well do you know\u00a0them?</li>\n<li>What is their strongest quality?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Not all referrals are the same, and these questions (and more) can help weight\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s the <em>way</em> they refer you\u200a\u2014\u200aor you refer them\u200a\u2014\u200athat matters. Be it email, text or phone call, and even the words they use, it can sink or buoy the introduction. Getting a referral is nuanced, and there is an art to it. (I feel a whole other post coming just on referrals.)</p>\n<h3>Time of Day Matters\u00a0Greatly</h3>\n<p>I have found the worst time to interview someone is between 2\u20135 PM. Can be their time or your time, but either way, those conversations often end up being dull and uninspiring. It\u2019s the doldrums of the\u00a0day.</p>\n<p>Best time tends to be 9\u201311 AM, and after work. Why after work? Because if they are still with a company, they often feel more at ease not talking \u2018on the clock\u2019, so to speak. They can also be distracted by having to step away to take the\u00a0call.</p>\n<h3>A Conversation Only about Hard Skills Is a Red Flag\u00a0\ud83d\udea9</h3>\n<p>If your interviewers are only throwing out questions about your technical skillset and not interested in learning more about your soft skills (problem-solving, collaboration, communication), run. You are not being hired to join a team so much as punch out\u00a0tickets.</p>\n<p>Goes both ways: if you are only asking questions about technical skills and not sussing out how they work with others, you need to look at how you manage your team. Your interview questions should match how you manage your team so as to be direct reflection of what they are applying to, and what you are hiring\u00a0for.</p>\n<h3>A Good Interviewer Is Incredibly Rare</h3>\n<p>When was the last time you were actively coached on how to interview well? When was the last time you read an article on best practices in interviewing? Or, asked a candidate to give you feedback on the interview and process? Likely never. And it shows to candidates quite\u00a0easily.</p>\n<p>I still remember those epic interviewers. I felt seen, valued, and inspired, even if I didn\u2019t get the\u00a0offer.</p>\n<p>You take the time to grow in your role and career, I strongly suggest taking the time to also grow in being an interviewer. Your company may have resources, or even reimburse you for coursework. A leadership coach or career coach is another goods resource for this. The return on investment is massive in that you will hire better, and have lower turnover.</p>\n<h3>Hiring for \u201cCulture Fit\u201d Can Be Deeply Problematic</h3>\n<p>While it\u2019s essential to have a cohesive and positive workplace culture, there are potential problems associated with over-indexing on culture fit. Beyond the legal risks\u2014it may be viewed as discriminatory\u2014you tend to drift into homogeneity, groupthink, develop a resistance to change, and miss out on bringing in fresh ideas and perspectives.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizational culture refers to the collective beliefs, behaviors, customs, and social norms that define how things are done within a\u00a0company.</li>\n<li>Company values are a set of guiding principles and beliefs that define what the organization stands for and what it considers important.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hire more for values than culture (there\u2019s a balance here!) Integrity, customer-centricity, creativity, curiosity, trust, these are guiding principles. Your company should have their values written down, and you should have interview questions that line up with\u00a0them.</p>\n<h3>Phone vs Zoom vs In-Person Is Wildly Different</h3>\n<p>This is pretty obvious, but what I want to point out is that I found interviews to go much better when you can match it to how they will be working with you, and with customers (internal as well as external). Meaning, if this role is for Sales and they will be spending a bulk of their time on email and the phone with customers, consider that the bulk of their interview be over email and the phone. You will get a better read on them than just in-person.</p>\n<p>When you can match the interview process to their day-to-day, both sides get a glimpse into how each side works and presents. And you should be seeing them in their\u00a0prime.</p>\n<p><em>You can\u2019t interview over email! That\u2019s odd. </em>Think again. You can interview over fax and semophore, if it made sense to the role. I once interviewed over HipChat (predecessor to Slack and\u00a0Teams.)</p>\n<h3>Panel Interviews Are Not for Every Role and Organization</h3>\n<p>I once worked at a startup that though they would save time by only doing panel interviews. Every candidate spoke to a recruiter, then a panel, then the hiring manager. They thought they were saving time and going fast, but it was a logistical nightmare, and really wore out the\u00a0teams.</p>\n<p>And to the above, not every role works that way. In some cases such as academia, a panel interview makes more sense as they tend to hold similar meetings in their day-to-day. For an executive assistant? It doesn\u2019t fit their day-to-day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tristandenyer.medium.com/how-to-conduct-a-virtual-panel-interview-cdfc199ce7ad\">How to Conduct a Virtual Panel Interview</a></p>\n<h3>Bonus Round: The No-Interview Process</h3>\n<p>Ready for this? Try the no-interview process where you do one interview and ask them to come on for a week (or a few days) as a paid contractor. (Okay, \u201cno-interview\u201d is a bit of a misnomer, but I\u2019m going for dramatic\u00a0here.)</p>\n<p>This works great for the type of candidate that has a strong and proven background, plus a strong referral, and did a great initial interview. Bring them on for a week to sit in on meetings, have lunch with coworkers, do work on projects, collaborate on a\u00a0problem.</p>\n<p>Granted, this is difficult for those candidates still employed, but with so many people out of work at time of writing, this could be a great option for some candidates.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve done this a number of times over the years, and it worked out well. I remember one candidate was a shining star on paper and had a strong referral, but then broke out the casual racism at lunch. Adios, dude! Another was not as great in the interview, but on paper had some amazing experience. The whole office loved her energy that week, and we made an offer before the week was up. (I still feel she would have never interviewed well in the traditional sense, so glad we we did this with\u00a0her.)</p>\n<h3>In Summary</h3>\n<p>A good hiring process is not just a means of filling vacant positions but a strategic function that can have a profound impact on an organization\u2019s overall success, from productivity and innovation to financial performance and brand reputation. It\u2019s an investment in the future of the company and its ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. It\u2019s how you show value to existing employees and teams in that you are taking the time to hire people who will have shared values, and continue to foster <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tristandenyer/how-leaders-can-ensure-all-voices-are-heard-on-their-team-f8b6a3043b26\">a safe space for diversity and inclusion</a>.</p>\n<p>Or, look at it like this: it is often better to leave a position empty than fill it with the wrong employee. Your hiring process matters greatly. You can lose more than that role as a ill-hired role can cause others to\u00a0leave.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1acbc2a918c2\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4>Both sides of the table, 1:1, multiples, and panel interviews. And that one time I got interviewed by a\u00a0dog.</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*j8f17xaIr0G-0odU\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Christina @ wocintechchat.com</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Over the years, I have participated in more than 500 interviews. As a candidate, as a peer, as a hiring manager, as a moderator on panels and even that one time where I interviewed twice in one day because they mixed us up. I once interviewed over 20 candidates in one\u00a0week.</p>\n<p>Did I mention I once got interview by a CEO\u2019s dog? Yeah, that happened.</p>\n<p>Here is what I have learned and use as a hiring\u00a0manager.</p>\n<h3>Snowflakes</h3>\n<p>No two interviews were ever the same. You would think with that many there would be some <em>deju vu</em> or repeats. But, no, I felt every one of them was run differently, had different patterns and workflows, or some oddity to it. (Again, who has their dog interview the candidate? Am I missing something here?)</p>\n<p>And not every interview should be run the same. As we will get to below, you should match the interview process to the day-to-day activities for that\u00a0role.</p>\n<h3>It Really Matters Who You\u00a0Know</h3>\n<p>This can be a referral from within, a shared coworker from the past, or a mentor or coach reaching out for them. I always find these to be a mixed bag, and learned to ask clarifying questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How well do you know\u00a0them?</li>\n<li>What is their strongest quality?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Not all referrals are the same, and these questions (and more) can help weight\u00a0them.</p>\n<p>And it\u2019s the <em>way</em> they refer you\u200a\u2014\u200aor you refer them\u200a\u2014\u200athat matters. Be it email, text or phone call, and even the words they use, it can sink or buoy the introduction. Getting a referral is nuanced, and there is an art to it. (I feel a whole other post coming just on referrals.)</p>\n<h3>Time of Day Matters\u00a0Greatly</h3>\n<p>I have found the worst time to interview someone is between 2\u20135 PM. Can be their time or your time, but either way, those conversations often end up being dull and uninspiring. It\u2019s the doldrums of the\u00a0day.</p>\n<p>Best time tends to be 9\u201311 AM, and after work. Why after work? Because if they are still with a company, they often feel more at ease not talking \u2018on the clock\u2019, so to speak. They can also be distracted by having to step away to take the\u00a0call.</p>\n<h3>A Conversation Only about Hard Skills Is a Red Flag\u00a0\ud83d\udea9</h3>\n<p>If your interviewers are only throwing out questions about your technical skillset and not interested in learning more about your soft skills (problem-solving, collaboration, communication), run. You are not being hired to join a team so much as punch out\u00a0tickets.</p>\n<p>Goes both ways: if you are only asking questions about technical skills and not sussing out how they work with others, you need to look at how you manage your team. Your interview questions should match how you manage your team so as to be direct reflection of what they are applying to, and what you are hiring\u00a0for.</p>\n<h3>A Good Interviewer Is Incredibly Rare</h3>\n<p>When was the last time you were actively coached on how to interview well? When was the last time you read an article on best practices in interviewing? Or, asked a candidate to give you feedback on the interview and process? Likely never. And it shows to candidates quite\u00a0easily.</p>\n<p>I still remember those epic interviewers. I felt seen, valued, and inspired, even if I didn\u2019t get the\u00a0offer.</p>\n<p>You take the time to grow in your role and career, I strongly suggest taking the time to also grow in being an interviewer. Your company may have resources, or even reimburse you for coursework. A leadership coach or career coach is another goods resource for this. The return on investment is massive in that you will hire better, and have lower turnover.</p>\n<h3>Hiring for \u201cCulture Fit\u201d Can Be Deeply Problematic</h3>\n<p>While it\u2019s essential to have a cohesive and positive workplace culture, there are potential problems associated with over-indexing on culture fit. Beyond the legal risks\u2014it may be viewed as discriminatory\u2014you tend to drift into homogeneity, groupthink, develop a resistance to change, and miss out on bringing in fresh ideas and perspectives.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Organizational culture refers to the collective beliefs, behaviors, customs, and social norms that define how things are done within a\u00a0company.</li>\n<li>Company values are a set of guiding principles and beliefs that define what the organization stands for and what it considers important.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hire more for values than culture (there\u2019s a balance here!) Integrity, customer-centricity, creativity, curiosity, trust, these are guiding principles. Your company should have their values written down, and you should have interview questions that line up with\u00a0them.</p>\n<h3>Phone vs Zoom vs In-Person Is Wildly Different</h3>\n<p>This is pretty obvious, but what I want to point out is that I found interviews to go much better when you can match it to how they will be working with you, and with customers (internal as well as external). Meaning, if this role is for Sales and they will be spending a bulk of their time on email and the phone with customers, consider that the bulk of their interview be over email and the phone. You will get a better read on them than just in-person.</p>\n<p>When you can match the interview process to their day-to-day, both sides get a glimpse into how each side works and presents. And you should be seeing them in their\u00a0prime.</p>\n<p><em>You can\u2019t interview over email! That\u2019s odd. </em>Think again. You can interview over fax and semophore, if it made sense to the role. I once interviewed over HipChat (predecessor to Slack and\u00a0Teams.)</p>\n<h3>Panel Interviews Are Not for Every Role and Organization</h3>\n<p>I once worked at a startup that though they would save time by only doing panel interviews. Every candidate spoke to a recruiter, then a panel, then the hiring manager. They thought they were saving time and going fast, but it was a logistical nightmare, and really wore out the\u00a0teams.</p>\n<p>And to the above, not every role works that way. In some cases such as academia, a panel interview makes more sense as they tend to hold similar meetings in their day-to-day. For an executive assistant? It doesn\u2019t fit their day-to-day.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://tristandenyer.medium.com/how-to-conduct-a-virtual-panel-interview-cdfc199ce7ad\">How to Conduct a Virtual Panel Interview</a></p>\n<h3>Bonus Round: The No-Interview Process</h3>\n<p>Ready for this? Try the no-interview process where you do one interview and ask them to come on for a week (or a few days) as a paid contractor. (Okay, \u201cno-interview\u201d is a bit of a misnomer, but I\u2019m going for dramatic\u00a0here.)</p>\n<p>This works great for the type of candidate that has a strong and proven background, plus a strong referral, and did a great initial interview.

There is a balance here in knowing how to source diverse individuals and knowing when to let aspects of their background, well, remain in the background.

But don\u2019t make it mandatory or push them to do\u00a0so.</p>\n<p>In this post, we explore strategies that leaders can employ to ensure that all voices are heard on their\u00a0team.</p>\n<h3>Lead by\u00a0Example</h3>\n<p>Leaders should set the tone for inclusivity by actively engaging in open and respectful communication. Encourage team members to share their thoughts and demonstrate that you value their input. When you lead by example, others are more likely to follow\u00a0suit.</p>\n<h3>Create a Safe\u00a0Space</h3>\n<p>Foster an environment where team members feel safe sharing their ideas, even if they differ from the majority\u2019s opinion.

Show empathy and validate their perspectives. Encourage others to do the same, promoting a culture of attentive listening.</p>\n<h3>Structured Meetings</h3>\n<p>Implement structured meeting formats that ensure everyone has an opportunity to speak. This may involve using round-robin discussions, rotating facilitators, or allocating time for each team member to share their insights.</p>\n<h3>Anonymous Feedback</h3>\n<p>Offer channels for anonymous feedback, such as suggestion boxes or anonymous surveys. This allows team members who may be hesitant to speak openly to voice their concerns or ideas without fear of repercussions.</p>\n<h3>Diverse Teams</h3>\n<p>Compose teams with diverse backgrounds, skills, and experiences. Diverse teams naturally bring a broader range of perspectives to the table, enhancing creativity and problem-solving. It can be easy to hire people just like you, but I implore you to push yourself in hiring outside your shadow, so to\u00a0speak.</p>\n<h3>Encourage Introverts</h3>\n<p>Recognize that not all team members are equally vocal. Introverted individuals may need more encouragement to share their thoughts. Create opportunities for them to contribute, such as through written submissions or one-on-one discussions.</p>\n<h3>Equality in Decision-Making</h3>\n<p>Ensure that decisions are made collectively and transparently. Involve team members in the decision-making process to a reasonable extent, allowing them to have a say in matters that affect their work. This is not \u2018design by committee\u2019\u2014that never works well\u2014but more inviting diversity to the\u00a0table.</p>\n<h3>Regular Check-Ins</h3>\n<p>Conduct regular <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tristandenyer/how-to-have-effective-one-on-ones-with-your-team-1dbd0f09c6ce\">one-on-one check-ins</a> with team members to understand their concerns, aspirations, and ideas.

It can manifest as emotional exhaustion, reduced effectiveness, a sense of disillusionment, detachment and more. While traditional strategies for burnout recovery like <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tristandenyer/investing-in-coaches-for-your-leaders-is-a-major-competitive-advantage-3ceff0fcda58\">coaching</a>, therapy, self-care and time management are invaluable, there are also some unconventional methods that leaders can explore to reignite their passion, creativity, and motivation. In this article, we will delve into some unlikely\u200a\u2014\u200aOr unconventional\u2014ways leaders can recover from feeling burnt\u00a0out.</p>\n<h3>Embrace Nature\u00a0Therapy</h3>\n<p>Spending time in nature can have a profound impact on mental well-being. Consider taking unconventional breaks to connect with the outdoors. Whether it\u2019s a hike in the woods, a walk on the beach, or simply sitting in a park, nature therapy can provide much-needed rejuvenation.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea: </strong>In early 2022, I went to Palm Springs and did the <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/museum-trail\">Museum Trail hike</a>. (It\u2019s listed as \u201chard\u201d, but I would call it \u201cmoderate\u201d, with much of it quite approachable by most hikers.) And! The views are amazing. Did I mention the random pull-up bar and weights someone dragged up there? Yeah, this hike was a great way to recharge, and reconnect with\u00a0nature.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xjdjem4h7vPNZS0SIq-YJw.jpeg\"><figcaption>Museum Trail in Palm Springs had this random pull-up bar and weights about half-way up. Amazing\u00a0hike!</figcaption></figure><h3>Immerse in the\u00a0Arts</h3>\n<p>Artistic pursuits like painting, drawing, or even learning a musical instrument can offer a unique form of therapy. Engaging in creative activities can help leaders channel their emotions, reduce stress, and stimulate their imaginations.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> Start by doodling. Just put down circles on a piece of paper. Headphones on, and let yourself zone out to just making circles for 20 mins. I did this for a week and found it really helpful as an alternative to meditating. Afterwards, my mind was calmer, and I even moved on to drawing flowers and other sketches.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lybM_fBtgvqEU9j8-1uSjA.jpeg\"><figcaption>Your doodling doesn\u2019t have top be anything, or even\u00a0good.</figcaption></figure><h3>Practice Mindful\u00a0Movement</h3>\n<p>Explore mindful movement practices like Tai Chi, Qigong, or dance. These activities combine physical movement with mindfulness, helping to reduce stress and promote mental\u00a0clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> The point is mindfulness to help calm your mind, or clear it. Your movements do not have to be hard or difficult. You can start by walking heel-toe-heel-toe to the fridge and back. Or doing the ostrich walk (Google it!) for 5\u201310 mins and concentrating on how ridiculous you look doing it. Again, do something new that you can concentrate on and clear your\u00a0mind.</p>\n<h3>Volunteer and Give\u00a0Back</h3>\n<p>Stepping outside the corporate environment and dedicating time to volunteer for a cause you\u2019re passionate about can provide a sense of fulfillment and perspective. Helping others can renew your sense of\u00a0purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> You can look into donating plasma. It\u2019s a fairly easy way to give back, and you often get paid for it! It takes about 20\u201340 mins, and will give you time to check out and read a book. You can set a weekly appointment, making this something to look forward to and give you a little something in your pocket for some self-care, like going to Palm Springs! Or doing one of the other items on this\u00a0list.</p>\n<h3>Laughter Yoga / Improv\u00a0Class</h3>\n<p>Hold up! Give this section a\u00a0chance!</p>\n<p>Laughter truly is the best medicine. Consider joining a laughter yoga class, where participants engage in laughter exercises that promote well-being and reduce stress. It may seem unconventional, but the benefits are real. The point is to break away from the mundane and do something new, while laughing and feeling silly doing\u00a0it.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> take an improv class! You cannot think about work while doing this, and that is the point: remove yourself from the thing that may be burning you out, and replacing it with silliness and laughter.</p>\n<h3>Unplug and Go\u00a0Offline</h3>\n<p>In a hyper-connected world, unplugging from technology can be refreshing. Try a digital detox by temporarily disconnecting from email, social media, and screens. This break can provide mental clarity and reduce\u00a0stress.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> I would couple this with a trip to Palm Springs I mentioned above. Going to the desert is a great way to give yourself a reason that you can\u2019t stay connected.</p>\n<h3>Explore Sensory Deprivation Tanks</h3>\n<p>Sensory deprivation tanks, also known as floatation tanks, offer a unique experience of weightlessness and sensory isolation. They can induce deep relaxation, reduce stress, and encourage introspection.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> If a cocoon of salt water and losing all your senses terrifies you, try a red light sauna. I feel that it is real quiet in there, and hard to think of anything besides the heat and sweating. \ud83e\udd75</p>\n<h3>Cold Water / Ice\u00a0Plunge</h3>\n<p>Cold exposure has been linked to the release of endorphins and increased levels of norepinephrine, which can improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression. The shock of cold water can also be mentally invigorating. Ice plunges trigger the body\u2019s stress response. Over time, regularly exposing yourself to cold water may help your body adapt to stress more effectively.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> you can also do an \u2018abbreviated\u2019 version of this with a large bowl of ice water and just plunging your face into it for as long as you can stand it. Repeat 3 times. We are activating the Vagus nerve here, and that has a load of health benefits.</p>\n<h3>Revisit Childhood Hobbies</h3>\n<p>Reconnecting with hobbies from your childhood or youth can bring a sense of nostalgia and joy. Whether it\u2019s building model airplanes, collecting stamps, or playing video games, these activities can be surprisingly therapeutic.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> I play Monopoly and other board games from my childhood with my son. The phone and laptop get put away, and we just concentrate on the game for a good solid 2 hours. It\u2019s been a fantastic way to take me back a number of years, and tell my son stories of which family memebers cheated the most. He loves hearing the stories, and is a great way to recharge.</p>\n<h3>Practice Lucid\u00a0Dreaming</h3>\n<p>Lucid dreaming is the ability to become aware that you are dreaming while in a dream. Exploring lucid dreaming can be a fascinating way to tap into your subconscious, process emotions, and gain insights. It is also beneficial in stress reduction, enhanced creativity, creative problem-solving, and\u00a0more.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> Before falling asleep, spend a couple minutes to repeat a mantra to yourself such as \u201cI will be aware that I\u2019m dreaming\u201d or \u201cI will have a lucid dream tonight.\u201d Combine this with visualization of yourself realizing you\u2019re in a dream. There are supplements out there to help with lucid dreaming, but will leave that bit up to you to research thoroughly.</p>\n<h3>Sound Healing</h3>\n<p>Sound therapy or sound healing involves exposure to various sounds and vibrations to promote relaxation and reduce stress. This can include gong baths, singing bowl sessions, or simply listening to calming\u00a0music.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> Look up theta waves on YouTube and grab your headphones. There are beta waves and much more, but I like theta for just zoning out and relaxing.</p>\n<h3>Cultural Immersion</h3>\n<p>Immerse yourself in a different culture or take a trip to a place with a vastly different lifestyle. Experiencing new cultures and perspectives can provide fresh insights and rejuvenate your\u00a0outlook.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> I am going to put money on it there is a place you have wanted to go, but have been putting off. If you are feeling burnt out, the time is now to make it happen. Don\u2019t put too much thought into it, and just go and figure it out when you get there. I\u2019m sure this is a place you\u2019ve already thought of enough to know what to do for a\u00a0weekend.</p>\n<h3>In Summary</h3>\n<p>Recovering from burnout doesn\u2019t always mean you have to follow a conventional path. Exploring these unlikely strategies can help leaders find unique sources of inspiration, relaxation, and healing. Remember that recovery is a personal journey, and what works for one leader may not work for another. The key is to remain open-minded and willing to experiment with different approaches until you find the unconventional method that resonates with you and helps you recover from burnout. Ultimately, the goal is check out so you can regain your enthusiasm, creativity, and resilience as a\u00a0leader.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=222e48c3debf\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4>Brace yourself for woo-woo and really out there ideas that\u00a0work!</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*reqeMQW12CMIeE-T\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@all_who_wander?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Kinga Howard</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Burnout is an all-too-common challenge that leaders face. It can manifest as emotional exhaustion, reduced effectiveness, a sense of disillusionment, detachment and more. While traditional strategies for burnout recovery like <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tristandenyer/investing-in-coaches-for-your-leaders-is-a-major-competitive-advantage-3ceff0fcda58\">coaching</a>, therapy, self-care and time management are invaluable, there are also some unconventional methods that leaders can explore to reignite their passion, creativity, and motivation. In this article, we will delve into some unlikely\u200a\u2014\u200aOr unconventional\u2014ways leaders can recover from feeling burnt\u00a0out.</p>\n<h3>Embrace Nature\u00a0Therapy</h3>\n<p>Spending time in nature can have a profound impact on mental well-being. Consider taking unconventional breaks to connect with the outdoors. Whether it\u2019s a hike in the woods, a walk on the beach, or simply sitting in a park, nature therapy can provide much-needed rejuvenation.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea: </strong>In early 2022, I went to Palm Springs and did the <a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/museum-trail\">Museum Trail hike</a>. (It\u2019s listed as \u201chard\u201d, but I would call it \u201cmoderate\u201d, with much of it quite approachable by most hikers.) And! The views are amazing. Did I mention the random pull-up bar and weights someone dragged up there? Yeah, this hike was a great way to recharge, and reconnect with\u00a0nature.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xjdjem4h7vPNZS0SIq-YJw.jpeg\"><figcaption>Museum Trail in Palm Springs had this random pull-up bar and weights about half-way up. Amazing\u00a0hike!</figcaption></figure><h3>Immerse in the\u00a0Arts</h3>\n<p>Artistic pursuits like painting, drawing, or even learning a musical instrument can offer a unique form of therapy. Engaging in creative activities can help leaders channel their emotions, reduce stress, and stimulate their imaginations.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> Start by doodling. Just put down circles on a piece of paper. Headphones on, and let yourself zone out to just making circles for 20 mins. I did this for a week and found it really helpful as an alternative to meditating. Afterwards, my mind was calmer, and I even moved on to drawing flowers and other sketches.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*lybM_fBtgvqEU9j8-1uSjA.jpeg\"><figcaption>Your doodling doesn\u2019t have top be anything, or even\u00a0good.</figcaption></figure><h3>Practice Mindful\u00a0Movement</h3>\n<p>Explore mindful movement practices like Tai Chi, Qigong, or dance. These activities combine physical movement with mindfulness, helping to reduce stress and promote mental\u00a0clarity.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> The point is mindfulness to help calm your mind, or clear it. Your movements do not have to be hard or difficult. You can start by walking heel-toe-heel-toe to the fridge and back. Or doing the ostrich walk (Google it!) for 5\u201310 mins and concentrating on how ridiculous you look doing it. Again, do something new that you can concentrate on and clear your\u00a0mind.</p>\n<h3>Volunteer and Give\u00a0Back</h3>\n<p>Stepping outside the corporate environment and dedicating time to volunteer for a cause you\u2019re passionate about can provide a sense of fulfillment and perspective. Helping others can renew your sense of\u00a0purpose.</p>\n<p><strong>Idea:</strong> You can look into donating plasma. It\u2019s a fairly easy way to give back, and you often get paid for it!

(Or maybe you do in your situation? \u2615\ufe0f) Start with the ones that seems to happen the most, and or the one that has the biggest potential negative\u00a0impact.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Identify potential mishaps:</strong> Begin by conducting a thorough assessment to identify potential outages or emergencies that could affect different aspects of your work. These may include natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods), technological failures (e.g., IT system crashes), supply chain disruptions, security breaches, or public health crises (e.g., pandemics).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Form a planning team:</strong> (Typically for larger responses) Create a dedicated team responsible for developing and maintaining the emergency plan. This team should include representatives from various departments and expertise areas to ensure comprehensive coverage.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Define objectives and priorities:</strong> Clearly articulate the objectives of the plan. What are you trying to achieve with this plan? Prioritize the most critical aspects of your work that need immediate attention during a\u00a0mishap.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Risk assessment:</strong> Conduct a risk assessment for each potential outage or emergency. Evaluate the likelihood of occurrence, potential impact, and consequences on your organization. This will help you prioritize and allocate resources appropriately.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Develop response procedures:</strong> Create step-by-step response procedures for each identified recovery proceedure. Outline the actions to be taken before, during, and after the mishap. Include details on roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and resource allocation. Steps should be clear and concise that most anyone can\u00a0follow.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communication plan:</strong> Develop a comprehensive communication plan that addresses internal and external communication during an outage. Define key contact points, methods of communication, and the chain of\u00a0command.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Resource allocation:</strong> Determine the resources needed to implement the recovery plan effectively. This includes personnel, equipment, financial resources, and any external support required.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Training and drills:</strong> (Typically for larger responses) Train your employees on the recovery plan and conduct regular drills or simulations to ensure everyone knows their roles and responsibilities.

But really, you should start writing it <em>before</em> the system or process is in place. When my team is working on a proposal for a new system, part of that proposal is a risk assessment, and in that assessment is much of the above. <em>How can this go sideways? Who will get it back online? How would we recover? What is the failover plan should it not come back online?</em> And more. That goes into our decision making, especially for critical systems. And that is used for the development of the recovery\u00a0plan.</p>\n<p>When the documentation (called runbooks and playbooks in my world) comes out for that new system, so does the emergency recovery plan. Then we do a training session on the system and how to recover\u00a0it.</p>\n<h4>And rewrite the\u00a0plan\u2026</h4>\n<p>Remember that emergency recovery plans should be adaptable and responsive to changing circumstances. Regularly revisit and refine your plans to stay prepared and resilient in the face of unforeseen challenges. A well-crafted plan can save you time, resources, money and brand reputation.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4da6e97f86d0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4>Learn why and how to develop emergency recovery plans for your systems, processes and workflows.</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*EGdZknYtcjJG640s\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@chrumo?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Piotr Chrobot</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>My first exposure to a mishap plan was when I was in the U.S. Navy.

When my team is working on a proposal for a new system, part of that proposal is a risk assessment, and in that assessment is much of the above. <em>How can this go sideways? Who will get it back online? How would we recover? What is the failover plan should it not come back online?</em> And more. That goes into our decision making, especially for critical systems. And that is used for the development of the recovery\u00a0plan.</p>\n<p>When the documentation (called runbooks and playbooks in my world) comes out for that new system, so does the emergency recovery plan. Then we do a training session on the system and how to recover\u00a0it.</p>\n<h4>And rewrite the\u00a0plan\u2026</h4>\n<p>Remember that emergency recovery plans should be adaptable and responsive to changing circumstances. Regularly revisit and refine your plans to stay prepared and resilient in the face of unforeseen challenges. A well-crafted plan can save you time, resources, money and brand reputation.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=4da6e97f86d0\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["emergency-response","team-management","management","product-management","leadership"]},{"title":"When Leadership Is Not About Leading","pubDate":"2023-10-16 13:06:01","link":"https://tristandenyer.medium.com/when-leadership-is-not-about-leading-ce75fd38b55e?source=rss-319fdd00a93f------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/ce75fd38b55e","author":"Tristan Denyer","thumbnail":"","description":"\n<h4>It happens.

While this traditional view of leadership holds true in many scenarios, there are instances where leadership takes on a different form. In fact, <strong>effective leadership can sometimes mean momentarily stepping back from the forefront</strong> and allowing others to step in, and\u00a0shine.</p>\n<p>Here are some times I learned when leadership is not about leading in the traditional sense, and why it\u2019s a crucial aspect of being an effective manager.</p>\n<h3>The Collaborative Approach</h3>\n<p>Effective leaders understand that leadership is not a solo act but a collaborative endeavor. They recognize that their role isn\u2019t solely about taking charge and directing every aspect of a project or team. Instead, it involves fostering an environment where team members can contribute their skills, ideas, and expertise to achieve common goals. Three ways this collaborative effort\u00a0happens:</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Empowerment: </strong>Leading by getting out of the\u00a0way</h4>\n<p>True leadership often means empowering team members to make decisions and take ownership of their work. It\u2019s about trusting your team\u2019s abilities and allowing them the autonomy to execute tasks and solve problems independently.</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Delegation: </strong>Leading by giving it\u00a0away</h4>\n<p>Effective leaders understand the value of delegation. They know that they don\u2019t have to be in control of every task or decision. Delegating responsibilities to team members not only relieves the leader\u2019s burden but also allows team members to develop their skills and take on leadership roles themselves.</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Support and guidance: </strong>Leading by finding the\u00a0way</h4>\n<p>Leadership is about providing support and guidance when needed. Rather than dictating every step, leaders offer help, answer questions, and provide resources to facilitate the team\u2019s progress.</p>\n<h4>Of note: where and when delegating is\u00a0hard</h4>\n<p>Delegating is not always something that you can do right out of the gate with a new team, or you being new to leading. You need to build that two-way trust with the team, learn who you can delegate tasks to, and know the resources available around you. Be patient, and give yourself some time to get this\u00a0right.</p>\n<h3>The Role of a Facilitator</h3>\n<p>In some situations, a leader\u2019s primary role shifts from directing to facilitating. This shift is particularly evident in collaborative and cross-functional projects, where different experts come together to achieve a common goal. In such cases, leadership is about facilitating discussions, mediating conflicts, and ensuring that all voices are\u00a0heard.</p>\n<h4><strong>Active listening: Leading by being\u00a0present</strong></h4>\n<p>Effective leadership in facilitation involves active listening. It\u2019s about giving team members the space to express their ideas and concerns and ensuring that everyone feels valued and heard. It\u2019s also about showing you are comprehending what they are\u00a0saying.</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Conflict resolution:</strong> Leading by being\u00a0calm</h4>\n<p>Leadership is often required when conflicts arise within a team. Leaders act as mediators, helping team members find common ground and reach consensus, ensuring that conflicts do not hinder progress.</p>\n<h4><strong>Decision-making support: Leading by being a\u00a0guide</strong></h4>\n<p>In collaborative settings, leaders may not make all the decisions. Instead, they guide the decision-making process, helping the team reach well-informed conclusions.</p>\n<h4>Of note: where and when facilitating is\u00a0hard</h4>\n<p>If you have the skills, facilitating is something you can do right out of the gate. When it can get difficult, is if you are distracted, there is a gnarly conflict, or the team is also new and not yet up to speed. Jump into active listening, and ease into decision-making support.</p>\n<h3>Building a Leadership Pipeline</h3>\n<p>Another critical aspect of leadership that is not always about leading in the traditional sense is developing future leaders within your organization. Effective managers recognize the importance of building a leadership pipeline by identifying and nurturing talent. This often involves mentorship, coaching, and providing opportunities for skill development.</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Mentoring:</strong> Sharing the\u00a0lead</h4>\n<p>Mentoring emerging leaders is a vital leadership role. It\u2019s about sharing knowledge, providing guidance, and helping mentees grow into leadership positions.</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Coaching:</strong> Showing the\u00a0lead</h4>\n<p>Effective leaders coach their team members, helping them identify their strengths and areas for improvement. <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tristandenyer/investing-in-coaches-for-your-leaders-is-a-major-competitive-advantage-3ceff0fcda58\">Coaching is an essential component of leadership development</a>.</p>\n<h4>\n<strong>Providing opportunities:</strong> Supplying the\u00a0lead</h4>\n<p>Leadership is also about creating opportunities for team members to take on leadership roles. This might involve assigning them to lead projects, manage teams, or represent the organization in various capacities.</p>\n<h4>Of note: where and when building a pipeline is\u00a0hard</h4>\n<p>The biggie for me has been when there is little to no support for you building a pipeline. Formalities, company culture, and other factors may hinder you doing this formally. Have patience, and tread\u00a0lightly.</p>\n<h3>In Summary</h3>\n<p>Leadership is a dynamic concept that adapts to different situations and contexts. Effective leaders understand that leadership is not always about leading in the traditional sense of taking charge and directing every aspect of a project or team. Instead, it can involve empowering, facilitating, supporting, and developing others. By recognizing when leadership takes on these alternative forms, managers can foster a collaborative and empowering work environment that promotes growth, innovation, and success for both individuals and the organization as a\u00a0whole.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ce75fd38b55e\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4>It happens.

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to management, the following mindset characteristics are often associated with effective managers:</p>\n<h4>If I could pick four as the most important, it would\u00a0be:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Emotional intelligence:</strong> Managers with high emotional intelligence (EQ) can understand, recognize, and manage their own emotions as well as those of their team members. They are empathetic, can navigate interpersonal dynamics, and build strong relationships. This is what makes you an even-keeled manager.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Integrity: </strong>An effective manager with integrity has a strong set of moral and ethical principles and behaviors that guide their actions, decisions, and interactions in a professional setting. This also builds trust within the team\u2014and across the organization\u2014as being a person that follows through with what they said they would do. And if they can\u2019t, they have the skills to communicate that effectively.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Growth Mindset:</strong> Effective managers believe in continuous improvement for their team, and are open to learning and adapting. They see challenges as opportunities for growth and view failures as valuable learning experiences.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communication skills:</strong> Strong communication skills are crucial for effective managers. It is the platform for the three skills above. They are clear, concise, and empathetic communicators, capable of conveying information, expectations, and feedback effectively.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>More traits of an effective manager:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer-centric mindset:</strong> Effective managers prioritize the needs and satisfaction of their customers, whether they are internal (cross-functional teams and stakeholders) or external (vendors, clients and customers). They understand the importance of active listening, delivering value, and meeting customer expectations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Results-oriented:</strong> Effective managers focus on achieving results and meeting objectives.

While it is important to have mentors, take courses, read books, I feel coaches are a <em>highly</em> effective tool in developing the skills\u00a0above.</p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t used a personal, career, or executive coach before, you are in for an awakening, literally. They are your partner in assessing where you are at today, pointing out blind spots, working with you on where you want to go tomorrow, and crafting a plan on how to get there. But, it\u2019s more than that. They fundamentally shift your mindset, help you find your authenticity, and bring out your strengths.</p>\n<p>After working with a coach (or a number of coaches, as I did), you won\u2019t just be an effective manager, but the skills you learn will improve every aspect of your life, from friendships to relationships, your self-worth, your confidence, and more. In general, this could take 3 months of weekly sessions to start to see improvements, 3 more months of bi-weekly sessions to really set it in motion, and monthly check-ins there after for any new developments or changes.

Here is this guy, probably making 3x what we were, who had no experience in what we were working on and he was our manager?!</p>\n<p>This is where I started to learn the importance that to be an effective manager does not mean you have all the answers, or technical experience. It means you know <em>how</em> to get the answers. He was resourceful, an active listener, creative, and empathetic.

And that really stuck with me and the\u00a0team.</p>\n<h3>Of Note</h3>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that while these mindset traits are valuable, effective managers also need to develop corresponding skills and behaviors to translate their mindset into action. Additionally, the specific mindset traits that are most crucial may vary depending on the organizational context and the nature of the team being managed. Be prepared to try things out, self-assess as well as ask for feedback, and adjust accordingly.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=b63d3830084b\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","content":"\n<h4>Tools and apps can help, but without the proper mindset, they fall\u00a0short.</h4>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*gsBx2HZZ2ynYPSVx\"><figcaption>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@brookecagle?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Brooke Cagle</a> on\u00a0<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>When I first became a manager, I found myself adopting tool after tool, app after app, methodologies and point systems, and still coming up short with managing my team.

While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to management, the following mindset characteristics are often associated with effective managers:</p>\n<h4>If I could pick four as the most important, it would\u00a0be:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Emotional intelligence:</strong> Managers with high emotional intelligence (EQ) can understand, recognize, and manage their own emotions as well as those of their team members. They are empathetic, can navigate interpersonal dynamics, and build strong relationships. This is what makes you an even-keeled manager.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Integrity: </strong>An effective manager with integrity has a strong set of moral and ethical principles and behaviors that guide their actions, decisions, and interactions in a professional setting. This also builds trust within the team\u2014and across the organization\u2014as being a person that follows through with what they said they would do. And if they can\u2019t, they have the skills to communicate that effectively.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Growth Mindset:</strong> Effective managers believe in continuous improvement for their team, and are open to learning and adapting. They see challenges as opportunities for growth and view failures as valuable learning experiences.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Communication skills:</strong> Strong communication skills are crucial for effective managers. It is the platform for the three skills above. They are clear, concise, and empathetic communicators, capable of conveying information, expectations, and feedback effectively.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>More traits of an effective manager:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Customer-centric mindset:</strong> Effective managers prioritize the needs and satisfaction of their customers, whether they are internal (cross-functional teams and stakeholders) or external (vendors, clients and customers). They understand the importance of active listening, delivering value, and meeting customer expectations.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Results-oriented:</strong> Effective managers focus on achieving results and meeting objectives. They set clear goals, track progress, and hold themselves and their team accountable for outcomes. They also know how to check in and adjust along the\u00a0way.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Proactive problem-solving:</strong> Managers with a proactive mindset anticipate challenges and take initiative to address them before they become major issues. They are solution-oriented and encourage their team to brainstorm creative solutions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Empowerment mindset: </strong>Effective managers empower their team members by delegating responsibilities, embracing their abilities, and providing the autonomy to make decisions.
