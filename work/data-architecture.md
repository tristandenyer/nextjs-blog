While at RealGravity, I worked closely with the data and web app teams to document their custom system architecture. While working with them, it quickly became obvious that the system was too complex to document well without a detailed visualization to accompany it.

I spoke with stakeholders on 4 different teams to gather the details of their components in the data platform, combined it with the knowledge I had on my section, and created a large format diagram of the entire data system, end -to-end.

We printed them on large format posters to help the entire team be able to explain it to other team members and visiting engineers. Changes were sketched on the posters and updated as needed.
